# HardGanache
test with hardhat and ganache

I could not find how to run the tests with ganache I installed the package but could not run it.
Also another thing is I could not figure out how to test with  owner /NotOwnerUserAccount

I made the tests run with a generic github action on push calling npm install first and then running a npx hardhat test.
